# How to synchronize the trackball in multiple WPF Charts
This article explains how to synchronize the Trackball in multiple WPF Charts using Syncfusion's SfChart control. Synchronizing the Trackball across multiple charts allows users to view related data points in different charts simultaneously, enhancing the data analysis experience. This is particularly useful when dealing with comparative data spread across multiple series or charts, as it provides a unified interaction mechanism.

# SFChart

The SfChart is a powerful and flexible charting library designed to render high-performance charts with a wide variety of customizable features. It supports multiple chart types, including Line, Bar, Area, and more, making it an excellent tool for visualizing complex datasets.

 # Trackball 

The TrackballBehavior is a useful feature in the SfChart that enables users to display interactive data tooltips when hovering over a chart. It provides detailed information about data points, such as their X and Y values, and can be customized to display additional content as required.
